## Details
The home page is the main web page. The club page is a dynamic page for a collection of clubs. The add club page is for inserting a new club to be displayed by the club page. The club details page is for displaying club information and a list of registered players. The manage players page is for adding, reassigning, and deregistering players. Razor pages were used to achieve consistent design and code reuse across the collected pages.
